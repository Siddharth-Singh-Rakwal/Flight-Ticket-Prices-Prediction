# Machine Learning Project
## Flight Fare Prediction
Using the Dataset of flight fares for different routes throughout the year, a Model is built and trained to predict the approx fare for any particular route.
- Got 95.80% Accuracy on this Project from Random Forest Regressor

## How It Works
The project follows a three-step process to provide accurate flight price predictions:

- Data Gathering: We collect an extensive range of flight-related data, including ticket prices, booking dates, departure and arrival information, and more.

- Machine Learning Magic: Our state-of-the-art machine learning models analyze the collected data, identify patterns, and create predictive models that can forecast flight prices based on multiple variables.

- Intelligent Recommendations: Equipped with these predictions, our system provides personalized recommendations to travelers, helping them make informed decisions and find the most cost-effective flight options.

## Usage
To use the 'Flight Price Prediction' Project, follow these steps:
- Make sure the project is set up on your local machine.
- Provide the required input data, such as departure city, destination, preferred travel dates, and any other relevant information.
- Run the prediction script or execute the application, depending on the project's structure.
- Review the generated predictions and recommendations for flight prices.
- Make informed decisions based on the predicted flight prices to book the most cost-effective flights.
